Key Security Findings:

S3 Bucket Configurations:
1. Missing Access Logging
   - All S3 buckets lack access logging configuration
   - Critical for audit and compliance requirements

2. Public Access Controls
   - Missing block public ACLs
   - Missing block public policy settings
   - RestrictPublicBuckets not enabled
   - Potential security risk for data exposure

3. Version Control
   - S3 buckets missing versioning
   - Important for data protection and recovery

Positive Security Controls:
- Server-side encryption enabled
- No direct READ/WRITE permissions to everyone
- VPC Flow Logs bucket properly configured

Remediation Steps:
1. Enable bucket versioning
2. Implement access logging
3. Enable all public access blocking settings
4. Add explicit deny policies for public access
