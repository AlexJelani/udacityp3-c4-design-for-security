1. Additional architectural changes to reduce attack surface:
- Move application behind a VPC endpoint
- Implement AWS WAF
- Use Application Load Balancer with strict security groups

2. VPC Endpoints impact:
- VPC endpoints would provide network-level protection
- However, IAM permissions would still control access

3. S3 Encryption:
- Default encryption only applies to new objects
- Existing objects remain in their current state

4. CloudFormation Impact:
- Changes made manually would be overwritten
- Need to update templates to maintain security controls" > E4T4.txt
